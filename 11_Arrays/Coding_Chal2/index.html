    Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to
    convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in
    their study. Your tasks:<br />
    Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
    ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:<br />
    1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the
    dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
    humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4<br />
    2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same
    as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)<br />
    3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already
    know from other challenges how we calculate averages ðŸ˜‰)<br />
    4. Run the function for both test datasets<br />
    Test data:<br />
    Â§ Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]<br />
    Â§ Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]<br />
    <script>
      const calcAverageHumanAge = function (ages) {
        const humanAges = ages.map((age) =>
          age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4
        );
        //console.log(humanAges);
        const adults = humanAges.filter((age) => age >= 18);
        //console.log(adults);

        const average =
          adults.reduce((acc, age) => acc + age, 0) / adults.length;
        return average;
      };

      const avg1 = calcAverageHumanAge([5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);
      const avg2 = calcAverageHumanAge([16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]);
      console.log(avg1, avg2);
    </script>
