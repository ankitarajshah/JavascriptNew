    Coding Challenge #4 Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time
    they are studying if dogs are eating too much or too little.<br />
    Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the
    recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.<br />
    Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range
    10% above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).<br />
    Your tasks:<br />
    1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog,
    calculate the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new
    property. Do not create a new array, simply loop over the array.<br />
    Forumla: recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of
    food, and the weight needs to be in kg)<br />
    2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or
    too little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find
    Sarah in the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose)
    ðŸ¤“<br />
    3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
    ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little
    ('ownersEatTooLittle').<br />
    4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this:
    "Matilda and Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and
    Michael's dogs eat too little!"<br />
    5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of
    food that is recommended (just true or false)<br />
    6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food
    (just true or false)<br />
    7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of
    food (try to reuse the condition used in 6.)<br />
    8. Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food
    portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the
    array's objects ðŸ˜‰)<br />
    Hints:<br />
    Â§ Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the
    summary lecture to choose between them ðŸ˜‰<br />
    Â§<br />
    Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means:<br />
    current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended * 1.10).<br />
    Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the
    recommended portion.
