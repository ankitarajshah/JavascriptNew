    Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".
<script>
    const massMark =70;
    const massJohn=50;
    const heightMark =2;
    const heightJohn =3;

    const BMIMark = massMark/(heightMark *heightMark )
    console.log(BMIMark)
    const BMIJohn = massJohn/(heightJohn *heightJohn )
    console.log(BMIJohn )
    const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn
    console.log(markHigherBMI)

    if(BMIMark>BMIJohn){
        console.log(`Mark's BMI ${BMIMark} is higher than John's!${BMIJohn}`)
    }
    else
    {
        console.log(`John's BMI ${MIJohn} is higher than Mark's ${(BMIMark)}`)
    }

</script>
